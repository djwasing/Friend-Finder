# Friend-Finder

Node.js/Express.js app using a survey to findyour best friend match from the popular TV series Top Gear. 

This was a particularly challenging assignment for me. The most difficult part of this assignment was the logic of handling the arrays within an array of objects. Comparing the user's scores with the scores for those already on file and returning the user with the lowest difference made for a real challenge. Through time, research, and utilizing my resources I was able to accomplish it. 

This is certainly a project I will continue to improve. Because I spent most of my time on the logic I didn't have time to style this site as much as I would have liked. I plan to go back and make this a more visually appealing and UX-friendly site in the near future.
